In this work, we develop an approximate Bayesian inference technique based on expectation propagation for approximating the posterior distribution formed from the Poisson likelihood function and a Laplace type prior distribution, eg, the anisotropic total variation prior. The approach iteratively yields a Gaussian approximation, and at each iteration, it updates the Gaussian approximation to one factor of the posterior distribution by moment matching. We derive explicit update formulas in terms of one-dimensional integrals, and also discuss stable and efficient quadrature rules for evaluating these integrals. The method is showcased on two-dimensional PET images.","tags":["Expectation Propagation","Poisson models","Emission Tomography"],"title":"Expectation Propagation for Poisson Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Simon Arridge","Kazufumi Ito","Bangti Jin","**Chen Zhang**","(with Hardy-Littlewood rule)"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1552772385,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552772385,"objectID":"626fbd4d13e67e328b971276a73d2e99","permalink":"http://chenz.xyz/publication/vga/","publishdate":"2019-03-16T21:39:45Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vga/","section":"publication","summary":"The Poisson model is frequently employed to describe count data, but in a Bayesian context it leads to an analytically intractable posterior probability distribution. In this work, we analyze a variational Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution arising from the Poisson model with a Gaussian prior. This is achieved by seeking an optimal Gaussian distribution minimizing the Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence from the posterior distribution to the approximation, or equivalently maximizing the lower bound for the model evidence. We derive an explicit expression for the lower bound, and show the existence and uniqueness of the optimal Gaussian approximation. The lower bound functional can be viewed as a variant of classical Tikhonov regularization that penalizes also the covariance. Then we develop an efficient alternating direction maximization algorithm for solving the optimization problem, and analyze its convergence. We discuss strategies for reducing the computational complexity via low rank structure of the forward operator and the sparsity of the covariance. Further, as an application of the lower bound, we discuss hierarchical Bayesian modeling for selecting the hyperparameter in the prior distribution, and propose a monotonically convergent algorithm for determining the hyperparameter. We present extensive numerical experiments to illustrate the Gaussian approximation and the algorithms.","tags":["Variational Inference","Poisson models","Transmission Tomography"],"title":"Variational Gaussian approximation for Poisson data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chen Zhang"],"categories":[],"content":" from IPython.core.display import Image Image('https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png')  print(\u0026quot;Welcome to Academic!\u0026quot;)  Welcome to Academic!
