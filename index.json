Its quantification is vital for assessing the reliability of relevant point estimates. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework for quantifying aleatoric uncertainty for deep residual learning and showcase its significant potential on image restoration. In the framework, we divide the conditional probability modeling for the residual variable into a deterministic homo-dimensional level, a stochastic low-dimensional level and a merging level. The low-dimensionality is especially suitable for sparse correlation between image pixels, enables efficient sampling for high dimensional problems and acts as a regularizer for the distribution. Preliminary numerical experiments show that the proposed method can give not only state-of-the-art point estimates of image restoration but also useful associated uncertainty information.","tags":["Conditional VAE","Image Restoration","Residual Learning","Uncertainty Quantification"],"title":"Probabilistic Residual Learning for Aleatoric Uncertainty in Image Restoration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Chen Zhang**","Simon Arridge","Bangti Jin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1552773515,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552773515,"objectID":"c9fca7e41bcd783074822c3bb901a292","permalink":"http://chenz.xyz/publication/ep/","publishdate":"2019-03-16T21:58:35Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ep/","section":"publication","summary":"The Poisson distribution arises naturally when dealing with data involving counts, and it has found many applications in inverse problems and imaging. In this work, we develop an approximate Bayesian inference technique based on expectation propagation for approximating the posterior distribution formed from the Poisson likelihood function and a Laplace type prior distribution, eg, the anisotropic total variation prior. The approach iteratively yields a Gaussian approximation, and at each iteration, it updates the Gaussian approximation to one factor of the posterior distribution by moment matching. We derive explicit update formulas in terms of one-dimensional integrals, and also discuss stable and efficient quadrature rules for evaluating these integrals. The method is showcased on two-dimensional PET images.","tags":["Expectation Propagation","Poisson models","Emission Tomography"],"title":"Expectation Propagation for Poisson Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Simon Arridge","Kazufumi Ito","Bangti Jin","**Chen Zhang**","(with Hardy-Littlewood rule)"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1552772385,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552772385,"objectID":"626fbd4d13e67e328b971276a73d2e99","permalink":"http://chenz.xyz/publication/vga/","publishdate":"2019-03-16T21:39:45Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vga/","section":"publication","summary":"The Poisson model is frequently employed to describe count data, but in a Bayesian context it leads to an analytically intractable posterior probability distribution. In this work, we analyze a variational Gaussian approximation to the posterior distribution arising from the Poisson model with a Gaussian prior. This is achieved by seeking an optimal Gaussian distribution minimizing the Kullback–Leibler divergence from the posterior distribution to the approximation, or equivalently maximizing the lower bound for the model evidence. We derive an explicit expression for the lower bound, and show the existence and uniqueness of the optimal Gaussian approximation. The lower bound functional can be viewed as a variant of classical Tikhonov regularization that penalizes also the covariance. Then we develop an efficient alternating direction maximization algorithm for solving the optimization problem, and analyze its convergence. We discuss strategies for reducing the computational complexity via low rank structure of the forward operator and the sparsity of the covariance. Further, as an application of the lower bound, we discuss hierarchical Bayesian modeling for selecting the hyperparameter in the prior distribution, and propose a monotonically convergent algorithm for determining the hyperparameter. We present extensive numerical experiments to illustrate the Gaussian approximation and the algorithms.","tags":["Variational Inference","Poisson models","Transmission Tomography"],"title":"Variational Gaussian approximation for Poisson data","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1544545800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1544545800,"objectID":"a267f50d5f4676649abc3006efcaaa2d","permalink":"http://chenz.xyz/talk/18-helsinki/","publishdate":"2019-03-16T22:22:17Z","relpermalink":"/talk/18-helsinki/","section":"talk","summary":"Finnish Inverse Problems Society Annual Meeting","tags":[],"title":"30-min contributed talk, Aalto University","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1530629100,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530629100,"objectID":"dce3b002720a5868a5089b8baca9c113","permalink":"http://chenz.xyz/talk/18-edinburgh/","publishdate":"2019-03-16T22:09:50Z","relpermalink":"/talk/18-edinburgh/","section":"talk","summary":"Computational Strategies for Large-scale Statistical Data Analysis Workshop","tags":[],"title":"45-min invited talk, International Centre for Mathematical Science","type":"talk"}]
