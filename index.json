He appreciates the full stack of quatitative and systematic approaches to understand the world, from statistical inference, probabilitisc / mathematical modelling, algorithmic design to scientific computing. His current endeavour is on the synergies of ideas \u0026amp; methodologies of Statistics and powerful toolsets of Deep Learning.\nHe received PhD in Computer Science from University College London with research topic at the interface of Inverse Problems, Bayesian Inference and Machine Learning. His doctoral research was fully funded by the UCL Computer Science Departmental Studentship (Overseas).\nBesides being a junior researcher, Chen is also a street photographer. He is invited to be one of the first six UCL photographers for UCL Instagrammer in Residence. Due to the current quarantine measures, Chen is enjoying cooking and baking in his leisure time.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"http://chenz.xyz/author/dr.-chen-zhang/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/dr.-chen-zhang/","section":"authors","summary":"Chen is currently a Machine Learning Research Intern in the AI Theory Research Group at London Research Centre, Huawei Technologies R\u0026amp;D, UK.
